<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

"Artify" is my end project for the 2nd semester of my bachelor programme. The goal was to design and develop a full-stack web application by using node.js. I decided to make a website for sharing art. In the final version of this project, which was done over the course of 2 weeks, users can create and customise an account, as well as upload and delete image posts. The UI design, code and also the example drawings were made by me.

Unfortunately, the database that was provided for the project by the university is not reliable, and the site might not be accessible at all times, however I have no control over this.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

As the name suggests, "Artify" is a website for sharing art. It was inspired by pages like DeviantArt or ArtStation. Users can create their own account and customise it with a profile picture and some personal information. The main feature of the site is the ability to upload images of your own creations (e.g. drawings, sculptures, cosplay), and to view the creations of others. As this was a small university project, the features are very limited, but future updates could potentially include the features like adding other's creations to a "Favourites" collection, writing comments on other's posts, or a forum.
